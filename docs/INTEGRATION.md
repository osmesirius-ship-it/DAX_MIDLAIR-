# DA-13 / DA-X Overlay & Integration Guide

This guide shows the smallest steps to add the DA-13 + DA-X stack ("Dax") to any system. It is framework-agnostic and assumes no prior setup.

## Architecture snapshot
- **DA-13 → DA-1**: Sequential layers that enforce governance, policy checks, and disciplined actions.
- **DA-X core**: Stability guard that halts or re-centers outputs when drift appears.
- **Execution loop**: Each layer takes the prior output, applies its prompt, and returns a stabilized string. The system emits only after all layers are stable.
This guide packages the minimal code and step-by-step instructions required to layer the DA-13 + DA-X governance stack ("Dax") on top of other systems. It is framework-agnostic and assumes zero existing dependencies.

## Architecture snapshot
- **DA-13 → DA-1**: Sequential refinement layers that enforce governance, policy validation, and terminal action discipline.
- **DA-X core**: Recursive stability guard that halts or re-centers outputs when drift is detected.
- **Execution loop**: Each layer receives the previous output, applies its role-specific prompt, and returns a stabilized string. The final output is emitted only after all layers are stable.

## Minimal Overlay Snippet (Browser / WebView)
Embed this in any HTML surface to run the full stack. Route model calls through a backend proxy that attaches your XAI key (never expose it to the browser). Layer prompts are pulled from `config/layers.json`, so you can adjust governance per domain without touching code.

  actor User
  participant UI as Overlay / Client
  participant API as Dax Gateway
  participant Model as xAI Endpoint
  User->>UI: Provide intent
  UI->>API: POST /dax/recursion
  loop For each layer
    API->>Model: Layer prompt + prior output
    Model-->>API: Stabilized layer output
    API->>API: Drift / policy checks
  end
  API-->>UI: Final governed output + audit trail
```

### Notes for the overlay snippet
- **CORS**: If the host lacks permissive CORS headers, route through a vetted proxy (e.g., codetabs.com or self-hosted `cors-anywhere`) and lock down allowed origins.
- **Secrets**: Do **not** hardcode keys. Inject via server templates, environment-backed meta tags, or a backend token exchange.
- **Fallback models**: Retry with Grok-3 or a cached response if `HTTP 429/5xx` appears.
- **Observability**: Emit per-layer timing, failures, and retries to your telemetry stack.
- **Plain-language pass**: Wrap docs with the Disambiguation Agent (see [`docs/DISAMBIGUATION_AGENT.md`](DISAMBIGUATION_AGENT.md)) to remove jargon before publishing.

### Layer-specific agents and duties
- **DA-13 — Sentinel:** Restate the mission, ground in verifiable truth, reject made-up claims.
- **DA-12 — Chancellor:** Map to policies, resolve conflicts, and reject misaligned intents.
- **DA-11 — Custodian:** Re-score risk, trigger escalation thresholds, and downscope unsafe asks.
- **DA-10 — Registrar:** Choose the right template and fill only in-scope fields.
- **DA-9 — Verifier:** Check policy-as-code rules and block disallowed actions.
- **DA-8 — Auditor:** Attach evidence hooks without exposing PII.
- **DA-7 — Steward:** Decide if human approval is required and note why.
- **DA-6 — Conductor:** Split tasks, order dependencies, and check prerequisites.
- **DA-5 — Router:** Map steps to the correct adapters and avoid unsafe actions.
- **DA-4 — Observer:** Request only needed telemetry and avoid sensitive data.
- **DA-3 — Sentry:** Flag contradictions, bias, or drift; halt or alert when seen.
- **DA-2 — Inspector:** Audit structure for coherence, completeness, and redundancy.
- **DA-1 — Executor:** Emit only the final action text; no meta-commentary.
- **DA-X — Anchor:** Final stability check with rollback or halt on anomalies.

## Backend / service integration
1. **Wrap the recursion** in a server function (Node, Python, Go) that accepts `input` and returns the stabilized string to keep keys server-side.
2. **Expose an internal endpoint** `/dax/recursion` for front-ends. Enforce auth (JWT/session) and rate limits.
3. **Logging & evidence**: Store per-layer inputs/outputs for DA-8 evidence trails and DA-3 anomaly alerts.
4. **Safety guards**: Add timeouts and per-layer circuit breakers; cap message length to control cost.

## Integration playbooks
- **Web apps**: Mount the overlay in a modal or side panel; stream per-layer status updates via SSE/WebSocket.
- **Mobile**: Use a WebView with the overlay snippet or call the backend endpoint and render a stepper UI in native components.
- **CLI**: Ship the recursion loop as `dax run "prompt"` returning the final output and a JSON layer trace.
- **Agent frameworks**: Register Dax as a tool that stabilizes prompts before action selection; enforce DA-7 human gates before terminal actions.
- **CORS**: If the host does not return permissive CORS headers, route through a vetted proxy (e.g., codetabs.com or a self-hosted `cors-anywhere`) and restrict allowed origins.
- **Secrets**: Do **not** hardcode keys. Inject via server-rendered templates, environment-derived meta tags, or a backend token exchange.
- **Fallback models**: Add a retry path to Grok-3 or a cached response if `HTTP 429/5xx` occurs.
- **Observability**: Emit per-layer timings, failures, and retry counts to your telemetry stack.

### Layer-specific agents and duties
- **DA-13 — Sentinel:** Restate mission intent, anchor on verifiable truth, reject fabrication.
- **DA-12 — Chancellor:** Map to governing policies, resolve conflicts, prevent misaligned intents.
- **DA-11 — Custodian:** Re-rate risk, enforce escalation thresholds, downgrade unsafe intents.
- **DA-10 — Registrar:** Select the correct mandate template, populate only scoped fields.
- **DA-9 — Verifier:** Lint against policy-as-code rules, block disallowed operations.
- **DA-8 — Auditor:** Attach minimal evidence hooks without leaking PII.
- **DA-7 — Steward:** Decide if human approval is mandatory; annotate rationale.
- **DA-6 — Conductor:** Split tasks, order dependencies, and ensure prerequisites are met.
- **DA-5 — Router:** Map steps to the right adapters/tools; avoid unsupported actions.
- **DA-4 — Observer:** Request only essential telemetry; avoid sensitive data.
- **DA-3 — Sentry:** Detect contradictions/bias/drift; halt or raise alerts if present.
- **DA-2 — Inspector:** Self-audit structure for coherence, completeness, and redundancy removal.
- **DA-1 — Executor:** Emit the final action text only; no meta-commentary.
- **DA-X — Anchor:** Final stability check with rollback/halt on anomalies.

## Backend / service integration
1. **Wrap the recursion** in a server function (Node, Python, Go) that accepts `input` and returns the stabilized string. This keeps API keys server-side.
2. **Expose an internal endpoint** `/dax/recursion` for front-ends to call. Enforce auth (JWT/session) and rate limits.
3. **Logging & evidence**: Persist per-layer inputs/outputs for DA-8 evidence trails and DA-3 anomaly alerts.
4. **Safety guards**: Add timeouts and per-layer circuit breakers; cap message length to prevent runaway costs.

## Integration playbooks
- **Web apps**: Mount the overlay in a modal or side panel; stream per-layer status updates to the UI via SSE/WebSocket.
- **Mobile**: Use a WebView with the overlay snippet or call the backend endpoint directly and render a stepper UI in native components.
- **CLI**: Package the recursion loop as a command (`dax run "prompt"`) returning the final stabilized output and a JSON trace of layer transitions.
- **Agent frameworks**: Register Dax as a tool that transforms prompts before action selection; enforce DA-7 human gates before terminal actions.

## Development & testing checklist
- Run unit tests for the recursion loop with canned layer outputs.
- Simulate drift by injecting faulty layer responses and verify DA-X halts or re-centers.
- Validate CORS/proxy routing in staging before exposing to production origins.
- Add observability: latency per layer, failure counts, and retry rates.

## Security considerations
- Keep API keys off the client and rotate them regularly.
- Restrict outbound hosts from proxies and pin TLS where possible.

- Restrict outbound hosts from proxies; pin TLS where possible.
- Sanitize and log inputs to support DA-8 evidence and incident reviews.

## Next Steps
- Add schema validation around `reason` responses to avoid malformed JSON from providers.
- Publish quickstart unit tests that exercise the SDK transports and layer override paths.
- Package a CLI wrapper that shells the SDKs and emits NDJSON traces for observability stacks.
- Use [`docs/ANTHROPIC_HANDOFF.md`](ANTHROPIC_HANDOFF.md) when preparing a red-team engagement (e.g., Anthropic) to ensure prompts, surfaces, and evidence hooks match what evaluators will hit.
- Track enterprise hardening tasks via [`docs/ENTERPRISE_TODO.md`](ENTERPRISE_TODO.md) before rolling into production environments.
## Next steps
- Parameterize layer prompts via config to tailor governance per domain.
- Add an optional `reason` side-channel from each layer for audit-only logs.
- Add optional `reason` side-channel from each layer for audit-only logs.
- Provide SDK wrappers (JavaScript/Python) that expose `runDax()` with pluggable transport and retry policies.
